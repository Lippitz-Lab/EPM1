description: >-
  This is the lecture notes (in German) of my lecture 'Aufbau der Materie I', as
  used in the winter semester 24/25. It  is a lecture for students in the third
  year of the Bachelor's programme.  In the selection and weighting of the
  topics, it is very closely  oriented to what is usual in Bayreuth.
