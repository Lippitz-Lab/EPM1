% 2. Photoelectric Effect
% Sim: Photoelectric Effect
% • This is a much harder topic for students than professors think. For details, see:
% www.colorado.edu/physics/EducationIssues/papers/McKagan_etal/photoelectric.pdf
% • Common student difficulties (many can be resolved with sim):
% - think voltage rather than light takes electrons off plate
% - think current increases with speed of electrons
% - can’t explain basic function of experiment
% - can’t explain classical model of light
% - can’t explain why PE experiment leads to photon model of light
% • A general problem that first appears here is that some students have no ability to think
% hypothetically and can’t separate what was expected classically from what really happens.


% 5. Atomic Spectra and Discharge Lamps
% Sim: Discharge Lamps
% • We teach spectra before the Bohr model in order to emphasize how Bohr was able to explain
% the observed spectra with his model.
% • Students often have trouble with the idea that the energy of light corresponds to the difference
% between the levels rather than the values of the levels. They need lots of explicit practice to
% get this distinction straightened out.
% • We get lots of questions about how the electron chooses which level to jump down to, and
% how it decides when to jump down. These questions are useful later for emphasizing why the
% Schrodinger model of the atom is better than the Bohr model.
% • The simulation and associated homework really help students build a clear model of how a
% discharge lamp work. The one place they had trouble was relating this model to what they
% see in a real discharge lamp, even though we did a demo with real discharge lamps and
% diffraction gratings. It’s important to be really explicit in this demo about how the physical
% lamps relate to the model in the sim.
% • When reminding students of Coulomb potential energy, they remember the equation kq1q2/r,
% but often don’t realize that this is the same as –ke²/r.
% • The idea of how fluorescent lights work is harder for students than you might think because
% they have trouble with the idea that red+blue+green light l



% 7. Balmer Series
% • We emphasize the point that Balmer came up with his formula by playing around with
% numbers and didn’t know what it meant. This is probably lost of students who think all of
% physics is like that.


% 8. Bohr and deBroglie Models of the atom
% Sim: Models of The Hydrogen Atom
% • For details about why and how we teach this topic, see:
% www.colorado.edu/physics/EducationIssues/papers/McKagan_etal/BohrModel_McKagan_etal.pdf
% • This is really an opportunity to teach modeling and the significance of Bohr explaining where
% Balmer’s equation came from and deBroglie explaining why there are fixed energy levels.
% This is a really difficult section for students who have trouble thinking hypothetically.
% • In the Bohr model, students often mix up total and potential energy, for example, thinking
% that -13.6eV is the potential energy. This confusion is confounded by the way the total
% energy lines are drawn on top of the potential energy curves.
